# Stealing in Beginworld

## WORK IN PROGRESS

- Stealing Costs 1 Mana Per Steal Attempt
- It's random but weighed toward less Wealthy Users.

We calculate the difference in User wealth, and the higher disparity
the higher chance of getting caught

Thieves Can't Vote
jr_boss: But then make the change of getting "caught" while stealing 50%
artmattdank: unless they are in the thieves guild?!?
zanuss: After coup you're not a thief anymore
eitanfuturo: @zanuss maybe you stop being a thief only if revolution wins?
zanuss: Do we de-register a thieves vote if they have voted before they get caught?
baldclap: if youre casught you dont get sound either
awfulwaffl3: thief if caught they lose cool points, and if they don't have
enough to cover the cool point loss, they go negative
zanuss: Maybe there is bail costs and it increases everytime you get caught
cachesking: negative? that's interesting. we'd have to submit sounds to pay our debt
bopojoe_: is the thief chance based on street Cred
cachesking: negative? that's interesting. we'd have to submit sounds to pay our debt
bopojoe_: more streetCret less chance of being classed as thief
awfulwaffl3: if you're a thief and get caught. you should be able to RNG to the
bot to pay sound as debt
jr_boss: Or make it so that when someone uses !steal, a random active chatter
gets called as a policeman by beginbotbot and when he types !arrest within like
10sec or so, he catches the thief

Citizen arrest!

How do I increase my stealth???

## User Suggestion

cachesking: as opposed to "buying" the coup, they can be about that "we" give
coolpoints too. that way we can see the coup rise w/ the people and others can
fight it down before the vote get's triggered

nomorequity: The side of the coup trigger should prevail, makes more sense to me

bopojoe_: so a peace coup only needs one person?
baldclap: can we bring wealth into it somehow
baldclap: i think the issue really lies in the coup cost
baldclap: how is a revolutionary suposed to afford 100
baldclap: but revolution costs 0 money, its all passion
bopojoe_: surely peace can band together too though?
bopojoe_: rev will always win then
eitanfuturo: I don't think that if peace wins wealth of revolutionary should be
redistributed but lost.  bopojoe_: will never be a peace coup jr_boss: @Bopojoe_
if multiple people want peace, they can donate cool points to one person and
trigger the coup
awfulwaffl3: So I think it works out well, and if peace wins then I do think a
small percent (1song) per peaceful should be redistributed. but I don't think
all songs for revol should be pulled together, i mean not all

---

bopojoe_: price for peace coup should be a percentage of rev coup
bopojoe_: rev coup should be higher
baldclap: no i disagree
baldclap: @Bopojoe_

Potential Punishments:
  - Mark you as thief

unlucksmcgee: Perhaps percentage is different based on the user you're stealing from. A rich user has more wealth so more security? A rich thief has more wealth to be more stealthy?
unlucksmcgee: Use GANs to generate artificial faces for the wanted posters using the username as a seed
unlucksmcgee: Perhaps make the random number 0.7 dynamic based on number of recent steals (similar to the police being on high alert from a recent steal

In the future activities in our economy should affect this numer
If a Revolution was crushed, Stealing should be very
It kinda implies police state
