We'll explain how this works

As you chat you get 🤠 Street Cred

  - You earn from just chatting!
  - Can not be used to gain anything
  - You can only give them away

✊ Giving Props:
  !props @viewer
  !props @viewer 10
  !props random

When you give someone Street Cred

They become 😎  Cool Point

😎  Cool Points Command:
  - !buy command
  - !buy random

💕 Sharing Commands:
  !share command @viewer
  Sharing sounds with a viewer
  costs Cool Points

📬 Transferring Commands:
  !give command @viewer
  !transfer command random

🍄  Mana

It costs 1 Mana per sound

Mana is replenished automatically at regular intervals

!hate

!love @user
You can make one user your Ride or Die.
This means that they will get one more Mana per Mana Drop.

If you don't like a sound
You can !hate INSERT_SOUND

or if you like a sound you can
!like
or
!love INSERT_SOUND

If the sound love ratio dips below 50%
than the sound is no longer playable
